//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of my own boards and using an ebyte module,
//be sure to change the definitions to match your own setup. Some pins such as DIO2,
//DIO3, BUZZER may not be in used by this sketch so they do not need to be
//connected and should be included and be set to -1.
